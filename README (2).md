The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction is crucial for success. Sentiment analysis on customer reviews can help airlines understand their customers' feelings and opinions, enabling them to improve their services. This project explores different machine learning techniques to classify customer sentiments effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer reviews from various airlines, obtained from Kaggle. Each review is labeled with the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The dataset includes the following features:

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach:

## Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understanding the distribution and nature of the data.
## Model Training: 
Applying various machine learning models to classify sentiments.
## Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
## Models Used
Several machine learning models were explored and compared in this project:

 - XGBoost
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - Support Vector Classifier
 - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
## Results 
The results from various models are compared using accuracy and the Random Forest Model showed the highest accuracy and the most robust performance.

## Conclusion
By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this project aims to improve the understanding of sentiment analysis in the airline industry. The results obtained from these analyses provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, helping airlines and stakeholders make informed decisions to enhance customer experience. This approach can be extended to other domains, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting customer sentiments in a dynamic and competitive environment.
